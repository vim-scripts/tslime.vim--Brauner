This is a simple vim script to send portion of text from a vim buffer to a running tmux session.

(1) This script provides the ability to send multiple keys to a tmux target at once.

(2) The tmux target is set on buffer basis. This means that every tab in Vim can have its own tmux target. (E.g. you could have a tab in which you edit a Python script and send text and keys to a Python repl and another tab in which you edit an R script and send text and keys to an R repl.)

(3) This script also includes functions to send text and key codes to a tmux session which ask for user input.

(4) In this fork of tslime.vim, keybindings are not set automatically for you. Instead, you can map whatever you like to one of the plugin-specific bindings in your .vimrc file.
