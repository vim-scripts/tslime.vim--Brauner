This is a simple vim script to send portion of text from a vim buffer to a running tmux session.

(1) This fork provides the ability to send multiple keys to a tmux target at once.

(2) The tmux target is set on buffer basis. This means that every tab in Vim can have its own tmux target. (E.g. you could have a tab in which you edit a Python script and send text and keys to a Python repl and another tab in which you edit an R script and send text and keys to an R repl.)

(3) This fork allows you to refer to panes either via their dynamic identifier which is a simple number. Or via their unique identifier which is a number prefixed with %.

a) Demonstrative Reference/Dynamic Reference: If you choose to refer to a pane via its dynamic identifier the target of any given send function in this script will change when you insert a new pane before the pane you used.

b) Proper Name/Static Reference: If you choose to refer to a pane via its unique identifier the target of any given send function in this script will stay fixed.

Tip: You can find out the unique identifier of a pane by either passing tmux list-panes -t x where x is the name of the session. Or (the easier way) you let the unique identifier of every pane be shown in your tmux status bar with the option #D; e.g.: set -g status-left #D. (All possible options about what to display in the statusbar can be found via man tmux or some internet searching.)

(4) In this fork of tslime.vim, keybindings are not set automatically for you. Instead, you can map whatever you'd like to one of the plugin-specific bindings in your .vimrc file.

The script can also be found on Github: https://github.com/lord-garbage/tslime.vim
